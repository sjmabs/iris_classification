# About
This is a short tutorial detailing how to use supervised machine learning models to predict classifications of Iris flowers using the features Sepal lenght/width and petal length/width. 

The tutorial walks through the following challenges:
- Loading a dataset - downloadable from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris
- Analysing the dataset
- Visualising the dataset
- Training models (logistic regression, SVM and Random Forest)
- Analysing the models
- Saving and loading the models to be used elsewhere

The tutorial uses Python and the following packages:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
